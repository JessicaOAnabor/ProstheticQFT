# ProstheticQFT - DoraHacks MIT iQuHACK 2025

## Introduction
A prosthetic ear is primarily intended to restore or improve auditory perception. It operates by capturing sound and processing it, typically utilizing microphones and digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms. The mechanism involves detecting sound waves, converting them into electrical signals, and employing algorithms (such as Fourier Transforms) to analyze and filter the frequencies before converting them back into signals that the user can perceive. 

## Approach
1. Modelled the enhancement of intricate sound signals, akin to those received by a prosthetic ear, through the utilization of quantum methodologies such as the Quantum Fourier Transform and quantum classifiers.
   
2. Applied Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in the functioning of prosthetic ears or hearing aids, enabling the breakdown of sound into its constituent frequency components via analyzing sound in both the time domain (the original signal) and the frequency domain (the output of the FFT).

## Results
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) presents opportunities for enhanced, probabilistic, and parallel signal processing in the future. This advancement could result in more adaptable, accurate, and efficient prosthetic ears; however, the direct implementation of QFT in prosthetics remains theoretical and is currently a subject of ongoing investigation.
